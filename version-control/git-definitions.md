# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
	* Version control allows us to view the entire history of revisions to one or more files, and merge revisions made by different people.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
	* A branch creates an independent working copy of code.
	* Changes are isolated in separate branches, which allows multiple people to make changes, simultaneously, without affecting the original code.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
	* A commit is a snapshot of code in Git
	* A commit has a unique ID and a message
	* A good commit message is specific to the changes made between that commit and the previous one
* What is a merge conflict?
	* A merge conflict happens when two people make changes to the same file and both commit their changes back to master.
